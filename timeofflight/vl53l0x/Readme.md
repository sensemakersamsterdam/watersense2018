Time Of Flight Sensors are sensors that time the reflection a laserbeam of a surface to a receiving sensor as to measure the distance. 

STMicroElectronics has three versions:

  * VL530L0X up to 2 meter
  * VL531L1X up to 4 meter
  * V1680X  0 up to 0.1 meter

We use the VL530L0X to measure the distance from the sensor to the waterlevel, so as to calculate the amount of water flowing (or standing) in a sewer pipe.
