# watersense2018
Sensing Water quality in a variety of ways.

This project is aimed at collecting various setups, source code and hardware designs that can be used
to sense different qualities of water and send the data to an open data aggregator.

It is an extension of the Waterbuoy project that has started in 2016.

The SodaqSewer and the RTOSSewer folders are the programs that integrate all the possible sensors Both are a work in Progress.

The other folders are Arduino tests for the different sensors.
